  "abstract": "Constraint Programming has been very successful in solving scheduling problems. In this talk we present a number of case studies from a user's perspective, focusing on how to develop a solution with off-the-shelf tools, rather than on the underlying technology. We discuss issues of tool choice, modeling approaches, visualization, and overall integration on sample problems. The first case study is a complex scheduling and planning problem for Siemens Energy, developed within the ASSISTANT European project. The second example looks at models for a Hospital Integrated Resource Management problem, based on the IHTC competition of 2024. The third case study is a generic scheduling tool which we have developed to provide a simple-to-use solution for small to medium sized scheduling problems. ",
