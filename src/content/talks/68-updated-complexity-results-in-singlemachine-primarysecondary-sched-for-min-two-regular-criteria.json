  "abstract": "In the primary-secondary scheduling problem, we have a primary scheduling criterion and a secondary scheduling criterion. The goal of the problem is to find a schedule which minimizes the second criterion, subject to the restriction that the primary criterion is minimized. Lee and Vairaktarakis [LV1993] presented a comprehensive review for the computational complexity of the single-machine primary-secondary scheduling problems, where all the jobs are released at time zero. When both of the two criteria are regular, more than twenty problems were posed as open in [LV1993]. This talk will report the research progress of these open problems. Jinjiang Yuan (J.J.
