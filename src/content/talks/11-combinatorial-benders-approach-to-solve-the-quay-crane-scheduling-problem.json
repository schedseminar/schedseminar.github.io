  "title": "Combinatorial Benders approach to solve the Quay Crane Scheduling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProblem",
  "abstract": "We propose an exact decomposition approach to solve the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP) in container terminals. The problem is decomposed into two simpler problems: a sequencing master problem and a scheduling sub-problem. The master problem explores possible operation sequencing solutions for the tasks, while the sub-problem determines the completion times for each task to avoid collisions among quay cranes. A series of combinatorial cuts based on minimum infeasible systems and minimum sub-optimal systems are generated to accelerate the algorithm convergence. Furthermore, we provide a cut selection strategy to generate tighter multiple cuts. Computational tests on benchmark instances verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
